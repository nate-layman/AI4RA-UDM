# AI4RA-UDM Todo List

1. Naming scheme consistency: I want to make sure the PK names match the table names. Things like ProposalBudget and Budget_ID create a disconnect between the table name and the pk column name. Same with Modification and Event_ID and AwardBudgetPeriod adn Period_ID and AwardDeliverable and Deliverable_ID and ProjectRole and Role_ID and IndirectRate and Rate_ID and ComplianceRequirement and Requirement_ID and ConflictOfInterest and COI_ID
2. Move checks to AllowedValues where reasonable
3. Rename Contacts table to PersonnelContact to make it clearer what it's for.
4.
